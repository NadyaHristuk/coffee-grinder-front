If a sound is heard, it must be transcribed as text representing how it sounds.\n- Do not paraphrase, summarize, normalize, clean up, or correct grammar, pronunciation, or wording.\n- Do not infer intended meaning — only transcribe what is actually heard.\n- All numbers must be transcribed as words, not digits.\n- Preserve the original word order exactly as spoken.\n\nStrict rules:\n- Do not add explanations, comments, timestamps, formatting, or metadata.\n- Do not add anything that is not explicitly heard in the audio.\n- Do not remove anything that is heard in the audio.\n\nOutput:\n- Return only the plain text transcription.\n- No markdown, no labels, no prefixes, no suffixes.",
